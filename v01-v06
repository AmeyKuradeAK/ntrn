Foundation roadmap: v0.3–v0.6
--------------------------------

v0.3: Code structure analysis
Goal: Parse and understand React/JSX code structure
Features:
Parse JSX/TSX files (using Babel parser)
Extract component structure (functional vs class)
Identify JSX elements used (div, button, input, etc.)
Extract basic props and attributes
Detect imports/exports
Identify text content and nested structures
Output: Analysis report showing what's in each file (elements, structure, complexity)

v0.4: Dependency & import mapping
Goal: Understand how files depend on each other
Features:
Map all imports/exports
Build dependency graph (which files import which)
Identify external libraries (React, Next.js, third-party)
Track component usage (which components use which)
Detect circular dependencies
Map relative vs absolute imports
Output: Dependency graph and import/export relationships

v0.5: Component & state analysis
Goal: Understand React patterns and state management
Features:
Detect React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.)
Identify component props and their types
Detect state variables and their usage
Identify event handlers (onClick, onChange, etc.)
Detect lifecycle methods (if class components)
Identify custom hooks
Map component composition (parent-child relationships)
Output: Component analysis showing props, state, hooks, and patterns

v0.6: Styling & configuration analysis
Goal: Understand styling approaches and project configuration
Features:
Detect styling methods (CSS modules, Tailwind, styled-components, inline styles)
Extract CSS classes and their usage
Analyze Tailwind classes (if used)
Extract color schemes, fonts, spacing patterns
Analyze next.config.js / build configuration
Detect routing patterns (Next.js routing structure)
Identify API routes and their structure
Output: Styling analysis and configuration mapping


Benefits of this approach
Better conversion decisions — understand what needs converting
Fewer errors — catch issues before conversion
Smarter mapping — know which Flutter widgets to use
Dependency handling — understand what needs to be converted together
Incremental progress — each version adds value


After v0.6 foundation
v0.7+: Start actual code conversion with full context
Better conversion quality
Fewer edge cases
More accurate Flutter code generation
Should I create a detailed plan for v0.3 (Code Structure Analysis) to start?
