# 🎯 **Implementation Summary: Interactive AI Assistant**
## Your Vision Realized: ChatGPT for React Native Projects

---

## 🚀 **What You Asked For:**

> "Can't it be more like perfect Cursor AI or something like v0.dev which is for web dev. But we are creating something for mobile native"

> "Also add 1 more option like if a person is in RN project dir and enter something like ntrn --prompt or ntrn --gpt then it will open prompt cli and after every prompt it should do whatever user says."

---

## ✅ **What I've Implemented:**

### **🔄 Primary Goal: Next.js Conversion (Existing)**
```bash
cd my-nextjs-app
ntrn
# Converts to React Native with quality-first approach
```

### **🤖 Secondary Goal: Interactive AI Assistant (NEW)**
```bash
cd my-react-native-app
ntrn --prompt
# or
ntrn --gpt
# Opens ChatGPT-like interface for project modifications
```
